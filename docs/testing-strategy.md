# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the SAKAMORI project, ensuring code quality and reliability.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Tool**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Location**: `__tests__` directories alongside components
- **Purpose**: Test individual components and functions
- **Naming Convention**: `*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Tool**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Location**: `__tests__` directories
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Component composition
  - Hook interactions
  - API integrations

### 3. E2E Tests (To be implemented)
- **Tool**: Cypress (planned)
- **Location**: `cypress/e2e`
- **Purpose**: Test complete user flows
- **Priority Flows**:
  - Authentication
  - License management
  - Inventory operations

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── layout/
│       ├── Header.tsx
│       └── __tests__/
│           └── Header.test.tsx
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAuth.ts
│   └── __mocks__/
│       └── useAuth.ts
└── __tests__/
    └── integration/
```

### Mocking Strategy
- Use `__mocks__` directories for module mocks
- Mock external services and APIs
- Prefer mock implementations over mock data

## Testing Guidelines

### Component Tests
1. Test both rendered output and behavior
2. Cover all meaningful component states
3. Test accessibility where applicable
4. Include responsive design tests

### Hook Tests
1. Test all possible states
2. Mock external dependencies
3. Test error conditions
4. Verify cleanup functions

### Test Coverage
- Aim for 80% coverage for critical paths
- Focus on business logic coverage
- Don't chase 100% coverage blindly

## Running Tests

### Commands
- `npm test`: Run all tests
- `npm test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage report (to be added)

### CI/CD Integration (Planned)
- Run tests on pull requests
- Block merges on test failures
- Generate and store coverage reports

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests focused and simple
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test error states and edge cases

### Don'ts
- Don't test implementation details
- Don't write brittle tests
- Don't duplicate test coverage
- Don't ignore test failures

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add E2E testing with Cypress
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing
- [ ] Add performance testing
- [ ] Improve test coverage reporting
